# InfoSecBooks

I has been sometime now that I am in the field of Information Security. And I am still a self-learning student of it. From time to time I find book related to it. These books may be helpful in teaching concepts or automating the tasks an "InfoSec Person" needs to perform. This is just the list of those books. To read more about each book ou can head towards to Github Pages(work in progress) I created for this repository at [https://cstayyab.github.io/InfoSecBooks](https://cstayyab.github.io/InfoSecBooks).

All these books are available on internet free on many locations, so I guess making one more copy of them won't harm anyone. But if you still think any particular book should not be here, feel free to [contact me](mailto:cstayyab@gmail.com) with the details.
